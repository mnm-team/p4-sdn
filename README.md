# p4-sdn
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based on [P4](https://staging.p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.2.4.html) and [P4-Runtime](https://staging.p4.org/p4-spec/p4runtime/v1.3.0/P4Runtime-Spec.html)

The library of this repository, p4utils, is based on the [p4-utils](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/p4-utils) repository, which is again based on the [p4-shell](https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime-shell) repository.

We implement further APIs for the SDN controller, e.g., packet-in, packet-out, APIs related to idle timeout, and provide useful examples.
