# p4-sdn
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based on P4 and P4-Runtime (check [p4.org/specs](https://p4.org/specs/) for specifications of P4 and P4Runtime).

The library of this repository, p4utils, is based on the [p4-utils](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/p4-utils) repository, which is again based on the [p4-shell](https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime-shell) repository.

We implement further APIs for the SDN controller, e.g., packet-in, packet-out, APIs related to idle timeout, and provide useful examples.
