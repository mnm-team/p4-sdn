In traditional networks, the control plane and data plane are tightly bundled in a network device. For example, the OSPF routing protocol (control plane) populates the routing table (data plane) in a router, each router has its own OSPF instance, these instances communicate with each other (via the connections between routers in the data plane) to have the global information of the network domain that they influence. 
This networking approach of distributed control plane facilitates the fast growth of a network (and the big Internet), however, it also largely  hinders network innovation. The control plane can only be defined, programmed, changed by network vendors, end-users can only enable, disable or configure some existing features on network devices, but cannot add or program a new function. The process of requesting a new feature from end-users to network vendors often takes months or years (see [SDN: the new norm for networks](https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wp-sdn-newnorm.pdf))
